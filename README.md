# This is a project with different Python suggestions to connect a simle joystick module with Raspberry Pi. 
#You need one Joystick Model, one MCP3008 analog to digital converter, cables scheme from this page https://tutorials-raspberrypi.de/joystick-am-raspberry-pi-benutzen-mit-mcp3008/ 
#and motivation to create a cute game.

###The last code is under this name joystick_test.py. If you want to implement the code, you should be shure that you have virtual environment for Python3.
If you have all extensions you can download it here:

sudo apt install wget
sudo wget https://github.com/veroabc/Joymapper/blob/master/scripts/joystick_test.py
#file open or
python joystick_test.py 
#check the file/ if you use raspi "nano" or "thonny"

thonny joystick_test.py
sudo nano joystick_test.py

#the script schould open the game, install the game before running the code
sudo apt install frozen-bubble
